TSPLIB: Questions and Answers</h1>

<hr><b>Q</b>: I found a better solution than the one claimed to be optimal
in TSPLIB, is this possible?
<p><b>A</b>: This never occured so far. In all cases when someone believed
to have found a better solution, it was not taken into account that it
is exactly specified how distances for TSPLIB problems have to computed.
Typical errors are
</p><ul>
<li>
evaluation of distances for geometric problem instances as floating-point
numbers,</li>

<li>
false computation of geographic distances,</li>

<li>
use of display coordinates for distance computations.</li>
</ul>
Note, however, that due to round-off errors distance evaluations may slightly
differ on different machines.
<hr><b>Q</b>: Are the given solution values only the best ones known?.
<p><b>A</b>: No, for every problem either the value of a provably optimal
solution or an interval given by the best known lower and upper bound is
listed. The optimality of solutions has been proven by branch-and-cut or
branch-and-bound algorithms.
</p><hr><b>Q</b>: I get wrong distances for problems of type GEO.
<p><b>A</b>: There has been some confusion of how to compute the distances.
I use the following code.
</p><p>For converting coordinate input to longitude and latitude in radian:
</p><p>&nbsp; PI = 3.141592;
</p><p>&nbsp; deg = (int) x[i];
<br>&nbsp; min = x[i]- deg;
<br>&nbsp; rad = PI * (deg + 5.0 * min/ 3.0) / 180.0;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>For computing the geographical distance:
</p><p>&nbsp;RRR = 6378.388;
</p><p>&nbsp;q1 = cos( longitude[i] - longitude[j] );
<br>&nbsp;q2 = cos( latitude[i] - latitude[j] );
<br>&nbsp;q3 = cos( latitude[i] + latitude[j] );
<br>&nbsp;dij = (int) ( RRR * acos( 0.5*((1.0+q1)*q2 - (1.0-q1)*q3) ) +
1.0);
</p><p>
</p><hr><b>Q</b>: What does the function nint() do?
<p><b>A</b>: The function "int nint (double x)" converts x into int format
rounding to the nearest int value, except halfway cases are rounded to
the int value larger in magnitude. This corresponds to the Fortran generic
intrinsic function nint. But, rounding like "(int) (x+0.5)" should give
the same results for TSPLIB problems.
<br>Actually, it is better to use just
"int" as in the previous answer.
</p><hr><b>Q</b>: Are contributions still welcome?
<p><b>A</b>: Basically yes, but, in view of the many problem instances
that are already available, new instances should either be real challenge
problems or be of general interest.
</p><hr><b>Q</b>: Is an optimal tour available for every solved problem instance?
<p><b>A</b>: No. We have included several optimal tours for testing purposes.
It is not intended to provide all optimal tours. It should still be a challenge
to find one.
</p><hr><b>Q:</b> Are there optimal solutions available for instances other
than symmetric ones?
<p><b>A</b>: So far, no other optimal solutions have been made available.
</p><hr><b>Q</b>: Which format has been used to store the data?
<p><b>A</b>: All data has been compressed with the command "gzip" and has
to be read using "gzip -d". Please contact your system administrator if
this command is not available.

<h1>
Some remarks</h1>
Here are some answers to questions or remarks that frequently occur.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
All files have been compressed under UNIX using "gzip". To uncompress the
files "gzip -d" has to be used.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Problem a280 contains a double node, so there are essentially only 279
nodes. We have not changed the problem name, though.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Display data must not be used for distance computations. It is only provided
for obtaining a graphical display of a problem.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
As written in the documentation, the asymmetric problems ftv90, ftv100,
ftv110, ftv120, ftv130, ftv140, ftv150, and ftv160 are all derived from
ftv170.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Yes, one can obtain "shorter" tours if distances are not rounded, but this
would define different problem instances.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
I do not keep track of the latest results on the vehicle routing problem
instances.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Optimal solutions are mathematically proven optimal solutions not just
heuristic solutions.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
There may exist several shortest tours for a problem instance.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Distances may differ slightly due to numerical rounding. But if there is
a big difference between your tour length and the tour lenghts provided
then there is certainly a mistake.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
We can give no further support for obtaining the data.</li>
